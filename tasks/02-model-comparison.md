# Task 2: Model Selection & Comparison

## Objective
Understand the difference between models and when to use each.

## Quick Overview

| Model | Best For | Speed |
|-------|----------|-------|
| GPT-4o | Complex reasoning, architecture | Slower |
| GPT-4o-mini | Quick completions, simple tasks | Fast |
| Claude 3.5 Sonnet | Code generation, analysis | Medium |

## Quick Test

1. Open Copilot Chat settings (gear icon)
2. Try the same prompt with different models:
   ```
   Write a Django middleware that logs request duration
   ```
3. Compare: quality, speed, explanation depth

## When to Switch Models
- **Complex refactoring** → Use stronger model (GPT-4o)
- **Quick fixes** → Use faster model (GPT-4o-mini)
- **Code review** → Use model with better explanations
