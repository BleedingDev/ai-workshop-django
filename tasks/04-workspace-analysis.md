# Task 4: @workspace for Codebase Analysis

## Objective
Use `@workspace` to analyze and understand the entire codebase.

## Instructions

1. Open Copilot Chat and use `@workspace`:
   ```
   @workspace What API endpoints are available in this project?
   ```

2. Find specific patterns:
   ```
   @workspace How is authentication implemented? Show me the flow.
   ```

3. Search for code patterns:
   ```
   @workspace Where are serializers defined and what do they validate?
   ```

4. Understand project structure:
   ```
   @workspace What is the relationship between User, Profile, and Article?
   ```

5. Find potential issues:
   ```
   @workspace Are there any security concerns in this codebase?
   ```

## Key Takeaways
- `@workspace` searches the entire project
- Use it for cross-file analysis
- Great for onboarding to new codebases
