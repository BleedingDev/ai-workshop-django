# Task 1: Ask & Plan for Analysis

## Objective
Learn to use Copilot Chat for analysis and planning before coding.

## Instructions

1. Open Copilot Chat (Ctrl+Shift+I / Cmd+Shift+I)

2. Ask Copilot to analyze the codebase:
   ```
   What is the architecture of this Django project?
   What apps does it have and what do they do?
   ```

3. Plan a task before implementing:
   ```
   I want to add rate limiting to the API.
   What approaches are available in Django REST Framework?
   What files would I need to modify?
   ```

4. Ask for clarification on existing code:
   ```
   Explain the authentication flow in this project.
   How does JWT token generation work?
   ```

## Key Takeaways
- Use Copilot Chat for understanding before coding
- Ask "what" and "how" questions
- Request analysis of trade-offs before implementation
